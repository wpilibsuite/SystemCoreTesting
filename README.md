### Powering On

Connect your Systemcore to your robot's power distribution board. We recommend the use of 18AWG wire with white Weidmuller ferrules.

Do not use both power inputs (Bridge + Weidmuller) simultaneously.

### Flash Mode

If the USBC-port is attached before power is applied, Systemcore will boot into flash mode.

### Flashing OS Updates
Update to the latest stable Alpha release to get started.

### Accessing the Web Interface and Setting Your Team Number

1. Boot Systemcore normally.
2. Connect via USB, Ethernet, or Wi-Fi
3. Navigate to http://robot.local in a web browser. 
4. Configure your team number in the configuration tab, and click the red "Change Team Number" Button.

6. Open the NI DriverStation and configure it with a matching team number
7. The NI DriverStation should establish communications with Systemcore at this point.

### Wi-Fi Configuration

Release 157 selects a default Wi-Fi channel. This is causing issues in some environments due to interference. Change the channel configuration to 'auto' and set the frequency band to 5Ghz for better connectivity.

### Deploying Your First Robot Program to Systemcore (C++/Java)

1. Boot and establish connectivity with your Systemcore.
2. Ensure WPILIB 2027 has been installed.
3. Open '2027_alpha1 WPILib VS Code' 
4. Make a new WPILib project as you normally would, and make sure to set the correct team number during the project creation step.
5. Deploy the project as you normally would.
6. The NI DriverStation should reflect the presence of robot code.

![](https://ik.imagekit.io/llimi/controlsystem/dscode.png)

7. You're now ready enable.
8. After initial testing with this new, simple, project, you can return to VS Code and open existing robot projects, which should trigger the Importer to create new 2027 projects based on those existing projects.

### Deploying Your First Robot Program to Systemcore (Python)

See [RobotPy specific notes](robotpy.md)

### Exploring On-Robot Telemetry with Elastic and AdvantageScope

[Package Installation Tutorial Video (30s)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/1095497571)

1. Download the Elastic and AdvantageScope IPK packages.
2. Navigate to the web interface.
3. Click the "Add Package" card. 
4. Install one package at a time.
5. Click the new "Elastic" or "AdvantageScope Lite" launch cards.
6. Use Elastic and AdvantageScope as you normally would. A quick way to add live telemetry to your robot is the use of the SmartDashboard API (subject to change soon) ```SmartDashboard.putNumber("key",value);```.
>**Elastic and AdvantageScope Lite packages will soon be pre-baked into the OS**

### Enabling CANivore Support

[Package Installation Tutorial Video (30s)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/1095497571)

1. [Download the CANivore IPK packages.](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/SystemCoreTesting/blob/main/CTR-Phoenix.md#download)
2. Navigate to the web interface.
3. Click the "Add Package" card. 
4. Install the usb-kernel package, and then install the usb package.
5. Powercycle your Systemcore.


### Making Cables

Check the "Mating Connector" Section of the specification sheet and [this github discussion](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/SystemCoreTesting/discussions/11).

### Transitioning from roboRIO
#### I2C

The I2C pinout does not match that of the roboRIO. Cables such as https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1729/?searchid=4554778&search_query=4+wire+i2c will need to be modified - SCL and SDA will need to be swapped. The Systemcore pinout matches the Qwiic / ControlHub pinout.

#### IO

The IO signal pins have a 4.7K pulldown resistor. Limit switches will need to short the SIGNAL pin to the +3.3V pin on Systemcore.
